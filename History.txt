=== 0.0.4 :: 2008-10-09

* Added the SNMPTrap notifier to make it possible to send failure notifications 
  as SNMP traps.
* Added the IOStream notifier to print failures to an output stream. By default
  the $stderr stream is used, but this can be configured to point to a file
  or any other output stream.

=== 0.0.3 :: 2008-04-02

* When a service doesn't respond, a ConnectionFailure is now correctly
  recorded. You can change how long Opticon will wait for a connection by
  setting the Opticon.default_timeout value. The timeout is 3 seconds by
  default.
* Changed require paths to fix strange loading problems experienced
  by some people.

=== 0.0.2 :: 2007-11-15

* A series of tests on a service can now be specified as a block to the 
  Service#test method.
* All failures generated inside a test block are all batched together
  into one notification.  
* Opticon test scripts can now be run with the "-v" switch to verbosely
  display what the script is doing.  
* Failure messages are now a bit more readable for non-techies.

=== 0.0.1 :: 2007-02-21

* First public release.
