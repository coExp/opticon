Opticon is a no-nonsense utility for monitoring HTTP-based services (i.e. websites).

When triggered, opticon connects to a list of URIs and checks to make sure that
they pass some arbitrary test, such as responding with a non-error HTTP response 
code, or returning content that matches a regular expression. In case of failure, 
opticon generates emails that can be forwarded to your mailbox, blackberry, 
cellphone,  etc.
